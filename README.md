# Timeless Skills

‪These are the timeless skills I wish I’d learned in school, and the resources I recommend to learn them.

Books, blog posts, YouTube videos, Tweets.

## Why this list?
1. I believe great content is worth re-consuming. So I'll refer back to this.
1. These are concepts that I want to pass on to my children, and the world.
1. To explore common threads in the content I've found most compelling.
