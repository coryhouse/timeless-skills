# Timeless Skills

‪These are the timeless skills I wish I’d learned in school, and the resources I recommend to learn them.

Books, blog posts, videos, podcasts, and tweets.

## Why this list?
1. These are concepts that I want to pass on to my children, and share with the world.
1. I believe great content is worth consuming multiple times. So I refer back to this.
